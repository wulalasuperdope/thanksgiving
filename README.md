# Assignment

## Setup

Run `npm install`
Make a database called `tgives`
All of the files and folders neccessary for completing the homework have been created for you

#### Models

You need to define 2 models: Person and Dish.

A person has name and an attending status.

A dish has name and description.

A person may be responsible for a dish.

~Be sure to create a seed file if you want to interact with your API outside of the tests,
as the tests will wipe the database everytime you run them.

#### Routes/Tests

Follow the test descriptions to fillout appropriate routes for `api/people` and `api/dishes`.

Note:
You will be building out all of the actual test logic for yourself.
A few example tests have been provided to help you get started.
Work on the people routes first then do the dishes routes.

To run tests use `npm test`.

To run tests in watch mode use `npm test:watch`.

You can also use `npm start` or `npm start:watch` to interact with your server without tests
